# Biography

I'm a software engineer by training. Since finishing my undergraduate studies, I've been working as a software engineer (full-stack and front-end) in multiple disciplines from software-defined networking management applications to customer analytics dashboards. 

My passion lies in analyzing data to extract insightful patterns, and Iâ€™m curious about uncovering illuminating stories data can tell and making predictive models by applying machine learning techniques.
